# Software-Development-Lifecycle
I would interpret the users needs by taking a census and figuring out the best features to incoporate into the software. 
Creating user stories can help with this as it gives me an end game, an objective of what the end product should look like as a result of my census. 
I would incorporate burn down charts in my agile methods in software development because I like the way they work and they seem like an effective way of keeping yourself on track and really seeing what needs to be done or what is already completed. 
Being a good team member means you are on track with all your tasks and you help when questions arise. You should help other team members because afterall, you are all on the same team with the same objective. 
Another good team member aspect is open communication with your team.
